# Minecraft in a week

My attempt to implement as many minecraft features as I can in a week. Written in C++ and using SFML only as a platform layer. Rendering is done with "modern" OpenGL (3.0). According to cloc it is about 2600 lines of code. My definition of a week was 7 days where I worked on the project.

Currently only tested on Ubuntu 14.04, should also run on Windows/Mac with minimal changes.
